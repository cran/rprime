\description{
Read in a text file generated by Eprime
}
\details{
The encoding on an Eprime txt file should be UCS-2 Little Endian,
  but sometimes this is not the case. We delegate the fussy encoding details
  to the \code{stringi::str_read_lines} function.

  If the file is not an Eprime txt--that is, if it is missing the lines
  \code{*** Header Start ***} and \code{*** Header End ***}--a warning is
  raised and the lines of text are replaced by a dummy header.
