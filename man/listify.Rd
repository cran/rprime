\description{

}
\details{
Some minor cleaning of the input is performed:
  \itemize{
    \item Lines without a colon-space separator \code{": "} are filtered out.
    \item Once the strings are split at the separator, white-space on the
          left and right sides of each half-string is omitted.}
